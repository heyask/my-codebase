I strive to write code that is easy to understand for anyone, considering not only rapid development but also the scalability, modularity, and stability of the code, and always thinking about
readability. I understand the cycle from planning to release well from the experience of conducting multiple projects. These experiences make it my biggest advantage to have a high understanding of
the work of related departments. I have an attitude to grow continuously through continuous capacity development and learning, not only as an engineer but also in life.
